1. You will need to open the Forge Installer you just downloaded, and select install the client version
2. On Windows, you will need to use `CTRL+R` and type in `%appdata%`. Then located the `.minecraft` folder and open it. On Mac, you will need to use Spotlight search and find `~/Library`. Inside the folder, go to `Application Support` and open the `minecraft` folder inside.
3. If there already exists a mod folder, skip this step. If not, create a new folder nammed `mods`.
4. Ensure that the mod folder is empty, and open the [downloaded folder of mods](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_D1uynMXBJxF8qOsiM-la8RXmz_uKxNu?usp=sharing). Inside the downloaded folder, you will find 4 `.JAR` files. Copy all the `.JAR` files into the  `mods` folder.
